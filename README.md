# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe in terminal

This project's roots are an initial following of a Sentdex Python 3 basics tutorial. 

A few of the things I added myself:
  Handling unexpected user input
  The computer player and it's automated turn
  Consolidating the check for a win condition for less redundant code
  Handling for a tie game
